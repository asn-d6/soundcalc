# soundcalc

ðŸš§ **Really really WIP right now. Please give us some time.** ðŸš§

A universal soundness calculator across FRI-based zkEVM proof systems and security regimes.

It aims to answer questions like:
- "What if RISC0 moves from Babybear^4 to Goldilocks^2?"
- "What if OpenVM moves from the Toy Problem Regime (TPR) to the capacity conjecture?"
- "What if ZisK moves from the Toy Problem Regime (TPR) to the provable unique-decoding regime?"

## Results

See the latest results in [`results.md`](results.md).

You can run the calculator by doing `python3 -m soundcalc`.
As a result, the calculator generates / updates [`results.md`](results.md).

## Supported systems

We currently support the following zkEVMs:
- RISC0
- Miden
- Zisk

We support the following security regimes (see below for explanation of regimes):
- Unique Decoding Regime (UDR)
- Johnson Bound Regime (JBR)
- Capacity Bound Regime (CBR)

In addition, we give a number based on the ethstark toy problem conjecture for reference.

## Background on Security Regimes

Consider a fixed set of parameters describing the prover and verifier of a FRI-based zkEVM.
To evaluate the *concrete soundness level* of such a system, we introduce a parameter `Î¸` in the range `(0, 1)`.

The soundness level is then determined as a function of `Î¸` and the zkEVM parameters (e.g., field size, code rate).
Depending on the value of `Î¸`, the analysis falls into different regimes:

- **UDR (Unique Decoding Regime):** $\theta  \leq  (1 - \rho)/2$, where $\rho$ is the code rate.
- **JBR (Johnson Bound Regime):** $(1 - \rho)/2 < \theta < 1 - \sqrt{\rho}$.
- **CBR (Capacity Bound Regime):** Roughly $\theta < 1 - \rho$.
  *Note: The analysis in this regime depends on unproven conjectures about Reedâ€“Solomon codes.*

Crucially, `Î¸` is not an input to the prover or verifier codeâ€”it is only used in the *soundness analysis*.
All three regimes therefore apply to the *same zkEVM instance* without any change.

The **Toy Problem Regime (TPR)** is different in a sense that no specific `Î¸` is used, but instead a conjecture on the concrete error bound is made.

## Project Layout

- `soundcalc/main.py`: Entry point
- `soundcalc/zkevms/`: One file per supported zkEVM
- `soundcalc/regimes/`: One file per regime (unique decoding, johnson bound, toy problem, ...)
- `soundcalc/common/`: Common utilities used by the entire codebase
- `soundcalc/report.py`: Markdown report generator
