# soundcalc

ðŸš§ **Really really WIP right now. Please give us some time.** ðŸš§

A universal soundness calculator across FRI-based zkEVM proof systems and security regimes.

It aims to answer questions like:
- "What if RISC0 moves from Babybear^4 to Goldilocks^2?"
- "What if OpenVM moves from the ethSTARK conjecture to the capacity conjecture?"
- "What if ZisK moves from the ethSTARK conjecture to the provable unique-decoding regime?"

## Results

See the latest results in [`results.md`](results.md).

You can run the calculator by doing `python3 -m soundcalc`

## Supported systems

We currently support the following zkEVMs:
- RISC0
- Miden

We support the following security regimes:
- Unique Decoding Regime (UDR)
- Johnson Bound Regime (JBR)
- Capacity Bound Regime (CBR)
- ethSTARK regime

## Project Layout

- `soundcalc/main.py`: Entry point
- `soundcalc/zkevms/`: One file per supported zkEVM
- `soundcalc/regimes/`: One file per regime (unique decoding, johnson bound, ethSTARK, ...)
- `soundcalc/common/`: Common utilities used by the entire codebase
- `soundcalc/report.py`: Markdown report generator
- `TODO`: A file with TODO tasks!
