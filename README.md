# soundcalc

üöß **Really really WIP right now. Please give us some time.** üöß

A universal soundness calculator across FRI-based zkEVM proof systems and security regimes.

It aims to answer questions like:
- "What if RISC0 moves from Babybear^4 to Goldilocks^2?"
- "What if OpenVM moves from the ethSTARK conjecture to the capacity conjecture?"
- "What if ZisK moves from the ethSTARK conjecture to the provable unique-decoding regime?"

## Results

See the latest results in [`results.md`](results.md).

You can run the calculator by doing `python3 -m soundcalc`.
As a result, the calculator generates / updates [`results.md`](results.md).

## Supported systems

We currently support the following zkEVMs:
- RISC0
- Miden

We support the following security regimes (see below for explanation of regimes):
- Unique Decoding Regime (UDR)
- Johnson Bound Regime (JBR)
- Capacity Bound Regime (CBR)
- ethSTARK Regime

## Background on Regimes

Consider a fixed set of parameters describing the prover and verifier of a FRI-based zkEVM.
To evaluate the *concrete soundness level* of such a system, we introduce a parameter `Œ∏` in the range `(0, 1)`.

The soundness level is then determined as a function of `Œ∏` and the zkEVM parameters (e.g., field size, code rate).
Depending on the value of `Œ∏`, the analysis falls into different regimes:

- **UDR (Unique Decoding Regime):** `Œ∏ ‚â§ (1 - œÅ)/2`, where `œÅ` is the code rate.
- **JBR (Johnson Bound Regime):** `(1 - œÅ)/2 < Œ∏ < 1 - ‚àöœÅ`.
- **CBR (Capacity-Based Regime):** Roughly `Œ∏ < 1 - œÅ`.
  *Note: The analysis in this regime depends on unproven conjectures about Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes.*

Crucially, `Œ∏` is not an input to the prover or verifier code‚Äîit is only used in the *soundness analysis*.
All three regimes therefore apply to the *same zkEVM instance* without any change.

The ethSTARK regime is different in a sense that no specific `Œ∏` is used, but instead a conjecture on the concrete error bound is made.

## Project Layout

- `soundcalc/main.py`: Entry point
- `soundcalc/zkevms/`: One file per supported zkEVM
- `soundcalc/regimes/`: One file per regime (unique decoding, johnson bound, ethSTARK, ...)
- `soundcalc/common/`: Common utilities used by the entire codebase
- `soundcalc/report.py`: Markdown report generator
- `TODO`: A file with TODO tasks!
